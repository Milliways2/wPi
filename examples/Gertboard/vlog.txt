I have been trying to run ~/wiringPi/examples/Gertboard/voltmeter and keep getting an error:-

Gertboard demo: Simple Voltmeters
=================================
Unable to open SPI device: No such file or directory

This should be OK, because I can successfully run the atod program included in the gertboard download, and the SPI jumpers are in place.

/usr/local/lib is in the path (as shown by sudo ldconfig -v)
and contains libwiringPiDev.so -> libwiringPiDev.so.2.0


I must admit I am also puzzled by the commands

gertboardAnalogSetup (100) ;
analogRead (100) ;
analogRead (101) ;
 
and am unsure what "pin 100" actually refers to and can't find in the documentation.
